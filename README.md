## Eat vegetables(I seriously doubt that pretzel is healthy)

carb is nutrient

## Exerciese

## USE CONDOM(and wait until your classmates and your whole town knows how slutty you are)

Rushing to be parents gogoogogogogogogogogogogoogogogogogogoogogogogogogogogo(professional producers)

## DRINKING AINT COOL LIKE YOU THINK 

I know it is cool when you get those walking aids and your classmates can sign the memorial card of your grave and laugh at you years down the road mocking all dumb teenagers are.(and those who laughted at you are were the dumb ones).

## Chemicals are not candies

candies are chemicals

A square is a special rectangle

and rectangles arent squres.

## Cigarette smells stick to people

It smells.

## Photosynthese(redox reaction)

Organic chemistry: 

CO2
carbon
dioxide
 + 
2H2A
electron donor
 + 
photons
light energy
 → 
[CH2O]
carbohydrate <
 + 
2A

 + 
H2O
water

## Solar Panel

it is based on the photoelectric effect and tells your parents to  stop hating on Einstein's legacy.

## kwh(apply to your electircal utlitiy consumptions)

kilo-watts-hour = power over time = energy * time = total amount of energy consumed over one hour

## kilo-byte && mega-byte

KB =1024 * 8 bit

MB = 1024 * 1024 * 8 bit

# Define the SMILES string for caffeine
caffeine_smiles = 'CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C(=O)N2C)C'

# Create a molecule object from the SMILES string
caffeine_molecule = Chem.MolFromSmiles(caffeine_smiles)

# Calculate the molecular weight of caffeine
molecular_weight = Descriptors.MolWt(caffeine_molecule)

# Get the canonical SMILES representation of caffeine
canonical_smiles = Chem.MolToSmiles(caffeine_molecule)

# Print the results
print(f"Molecular Weight of Caffeine: {molecular_weight:.2f} g/mol")
print(f"Canonical SMILES of Caffeine: {canonical_smiles}")
```

Keep blaming the dopamine. <em>It is okay it is just your hormone and dopamine.</em>

# What drives people insane

not 1 body
not 2 body
nor 3 body

it is Avergardo-body
